#• What is the project about?

The project is about making a website for a TV shows and movie streaming service for the company called Tasty TV that has programs that run in 12hours intervals. The page needed all the sub web-pages and social media links which Tasty TV have.

#• Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?

Yes, I have wireframes for each sub web-page. The wireframes show the plan of how I would build the website. This is followed by user stories, which tell the user the features they will be able to apply on the website, for the users benefit. I have also attached the CodeSandbox link of code used to build the website, as well as the Tasty TV website link which can be opened on a new webpage tab.

#• What features did you include?
##o Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)

5 subpages (Home, Announcements, Schedule, Registration, Random Movie).

I added button links from the homepage logo to link to the home page (index.html). I also have button links for 5 social media links, where when you click on the logo, it directs you to that specific social media website. I included a search bar, a background image of assortment of movies.

The website also includes a registration form, and a list of programs available for the user.

#• What was your favourite part to work on?

The favourite part was to create a picture in my head of how the website should look and operate and being able to create on the most part.

#• What was the most difficult part of the project?

The functionality to create a random movie generator, because I struggled with working with JavaScript functions. Although I was able to sort out the sample data into an array.

#• What would you like to add next?

Add the random movie generator to my website, that would really complete the webpage and add more realness to the website.

#• Demo of the website

Done in presentation.
